Kaladi’s are usually made from cow’s or buffalo’s milk, though kaladi’s made from goat’s milk are also available, and have a color.Traditionally Kaladi’s are made from raw (uncooked) full fat milk that is separated using soured milk. The solidified part is paced in doonas (small bowls made of leaves) and sun dried. The excess liquid drips down from the semi-porous doonas and rest of the moisture is lost by sun drying.As the ambient temperature is low and the sun is strong in the mountains, the Kaladi becomes dry from outside yet retains moisture from inside. Some times fungus grows on this and gives it a unique flavor.",
